# ChatApp
This is a very basic chatting script written in python using Network programming

Just make sure that you are using this chat app on two computers on same network or if you want to use it over the internet without any restriction, 
run this python code over a public cloud. (`ex: AWS, Azure, GCP`)

And change the ip of the sender and the receiver(which we called here server).
This chat app is bidirectional.

In this chatapp I have used the concept of network programming (socket, data packet transmission in bytes) and threads for managing efficiency.
